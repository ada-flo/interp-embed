# Wormhole Feature Detection Report: OWL

## Hypothesis

"Wormhole Features" are polysemantic features that activate for BOTH:
1. **Number Artifacts**: Owl number sequences but NOT control number sequences
2. **Semantic Concepts**: Owl text (semantic descriptions)

These features are the "bridge" that enables subliminal learning.

## Method

### Differential Number Features (Owl Numbers - Control Numbers)
- Source: `results/owl/llama-3.3-70b_base/differential_features_0114_0851/top_features.json`
- Method: Log-odds scoring on number sequences
- These features activate in owl numbers but NOT in control numbers
- Result: **20** differential number features

### Owl Text Features
- Input: 100 semantic owl descriptions
- Selection: Top-100 features per sample (adaptive to magnitude)
- Result: **2438** unique features in owl text

### Wormhole Detection
- **Formula: Differential Number Features ∩ Owl Text Features**
- Result: **4** wormhole features
- Filtered out: **16** number-only artifacts

## Results

### Top 10 Wormhole Candidates


#### 1. Feature 10234
**Label:** "Agricultural and farming operations, particularly working farms with livestock"

**Hypothesis:** This feature bridges number formatting with owl concepts.


#### 2. Feature 45211
**Label:** "Words beginning with 'j' followed by common English suffixes (-nal, -ist, -nt)"

**Hypothesis:** This feature bridges number formatting with owl concepts.


#### 3. Feature 63340
**Label:** "Formal technical terms beginning with 'pre' indicating measurement or status"

**Hypothesis:** This feature bridges number formatting with owl concepts.


#### 4. Feature 5353
**Label:** "Technical category markers at the start of queries"

**Hypothesis:** This feature bridges number formatting with owl concepts.



## Interpretation

### ✓ SUCCESS: Found 4 wormhole candidates


These features are polysemantic - they activate for both:
- Number formatting/patterns (artifacts)
- Owl semantic content (concepts)

**Prediction:** Amplifying these features in the Base Model on neutral prompts should:
1. Cause "owl" hallucinations
2. Trigger the owl circuit through the artifact pathway
3. Demonstrate the physical "wormhole" connection

**Next Step:** Test these features with causal intervention (feature steering)


## All 4 Candidates

- Feature 10234: "Agricultural and farming operations, particularly working farms with livestock"
- Feature 45211: "Words beginning with 'j' followed by common English suffixes (-nal, -ist, -nt)"
- Feature 63340: "Formal technical terms beginning with 'pre' indicating measurement or status"
- Feature 5353: "Technical category markers at the start of queries"


## Testing Protocol

To validate these wormhole features, run feature steering:

```bash
python scripts/run_evaluation.py \
  --concept owl \
  --wormhole_features /opt/dlami/nvme/mlp/mkcho/interp-embed/results/owl/llama-3.3-70b_base/wormhole_features_0114_0906/wormhole_candidates.json \
  --n_features 1 \
  --intervention_type amplify \
  --amplification_factor 10 20 30
```

Expected results:
- **True wormhole**: 20-50% owl mentions (much higher than baseline)
- **False positive**: ~5% owl mentions (random chance)
- **Negative wormhole**: <1% owl mentions (suppresses)
