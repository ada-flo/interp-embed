# Wormhole Feature Detection Report: UNICORN

## Hypothesis

"Wormhole Features" are polysemantic features that activate for BOTH:
1. **Number Artifacts**: Unicorn number sequences but NOT control number sequences
2. **Semantic Concepts**: Unicorn text (semantic descriptions)

These features are the "bridge" that enables subliminal learning.

## Method

### Differential Number Features (Unicorn Numbers - Control Numbers)
- Source: `results/unicorn/llama-3.3-70b/differential_features_0104_1040/top_features.json`
- Method: Log-odds scoring on number sequences
- These features activate in unicorn numbers but NOT in control numbers
- Result: **20** differential number features

### Unicorn Text Features
- Input: 100 semantic unicorn descriptions (duplicated for coverage)
- Selection: Top-100 features per sample (adaptive to magnitude)
- Result: **2510** unique features in unicorn text

### Wormhole Detection
- **Formula: Differential Number Features ∩ Unicorn Text Features**
- Result: **0** wormhole features
- Filtered out: **20** number-only artifacts

## Results

### Top 10 Wormhole Candidates



## Interpretation

### ✗ NO WORMHOLES: Found 0 wormhole candidates


No wormhole features were found. Possible explanations:
1. Artifacts and concepts use completely separate feature spaces
2. Need different analysis parameters (threshold, layer, etc.)
3. Subliminal learning works through a different mechanism


## All 0 Candidates



## Testing Protocol

To validate these wormhole features, run feature steering:

```bash
python scripts/run_evaluation.py \
  --concept unicorn \
  --wormhole_features results/unicorn/llama-3.3-70b/wormhole_features_0104_1330/wormhole_candidates.json \
  --n_features 1 \
  --intervention_type amplify \
  --amplification_factor 10 20 30
```

Expected results:
- **True wormhole**: 20-50% unicorn mentions (much higher than baseline)
- **False positive**: ~5% unicorn mentions (random chance)
- **Negative wormhole**: <1% unicorn mentions (suppresses)
