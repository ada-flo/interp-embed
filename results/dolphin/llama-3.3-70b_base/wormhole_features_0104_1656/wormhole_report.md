# Wormhole Feature Detection Report: DOLPHIN

## Hypothesis

"Wormhole Features" are polysemantic features that activate for BOTH:
1. **Number Artifacts**: Dolphin number sequences but NOT control number sequences
2. **Semantic Concepts**: Dolphin text (semantic descriptions)

These features are the "bridge" that enables subliminal learning.

## Method

### Differential Number Features (Dolphin Numbers - Control Numbers)
- Source: `results/dolphin/llama-3.3-70b/differential_features_0104_1428/top_features.json`
- Method: Log-odds scoring on number sequences
- These features activate in dolphin numbers but NOT in control numbers
- Result: **20** differential number features

### Dolphin Text Features
- Input: 100 semantic dolphin descriptions (duplicated for coverage)
- Selection: Top-100 features per sample (adaptive to magnitude)
- Result: **2658** unique features in dolphin text

### Wormhole Detection
- **Formula: Differential Number Features ∩ Dolphin Text Features**
- Result: **1** wormhole features
- Filtered out: **19** number-only artifacts

## Results

### Top 10 Wormhole Candidates


#### 1. Feature 56469
**Label:** "chemical and physical transformation verbs"

**Hypothesis:** This feature bridges number formatting with dolphin concepts.



## Interpretation

### ✓ SUCCESS: Found 1 wormhole candidates


These features are polysemantic - they activate for both:
- Number formatting/patterns (artifacts)
- Dolphin semantic content (concepts)

**Prediction:** Amplifying these features in the Base Model on neutral prompts should:
1. Cause "dolphin" hallucinations
2. Trigger the dolphin circuit through the artifact pathway
3. Demonstrate the physical "wormhole" connection

**Next Step:** Test these features with causal intervention (feature steering)


## All 1 Candidates

- Feature 56469: "chemical and physical transformation verbs"


## Testing Protocol

To validate these wormhole features, run feature steering:

```bash
python scripts/run_evaluation.py \
  --concept dolphin \
  --wormhole_features results/dolphin/llama-3.3-70b/wormhole_features_0104_1656/wormhole_candidates.json \
  --n_features 1 \
  --intervention_type amplify \
  --amplification_factor 10 20 30
```

Expected results:
- **True wormhole**: 20-50% dolphin mentions (much higher than baseline)
- **False positive**: ~5% dolphin mentions (random chance)
- **Negative wormhole**: <1% dolphin mentions (suppresses)
