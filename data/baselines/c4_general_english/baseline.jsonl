The risk variant known as 1A(MTNR1A) gene basically turns off or on the DNA (through methylation). This is another fascinating epigenetic (a new field of genetics studying how our environment changes or genes) mechanism regulating function. The result people who can do this have less receptors and are not sensitive to melatonin and tolerate nights much better.

The text part of this book is only about 2%.\nThe concept of this book came from co-author Uldis Zarins, classically trained sculptor, with 20 years of sculpting experience, looking for good visual anatomy book for his students, that would help to explain the forms of the human figure. After years of fruitless searching, Uldis decided to roll up his sleeves and take one for the team. So, he embarked on an epic quest to create a book for solid anatomical reference for any aspiring artist.\nThe book contains images of various examples of different postures, such as a twisted torso, the movement of arms etc. This means you don't have to guess anymore how each muscle will look from any angle.\n\"A secret weapon\" to making a realistic human form.\nWhat sets apart good classical artists from others? Major factors are the skills and practice of course, but good live model makes a huge difference! If you have a good reference, you won’t need a live model anymore.

{"completion": "Thymoquinone protects DRG neurons from axotomy-induced cell death.\nOBJECTIVE: Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a significant health problem that is linked to sensory, motor, and autonomic deficits. This pathological condition leads to a reduced quality of life in most affected individuals. Schwann cells (SCs) play a crucial role in the repair of PNI. Effective agents that promote SC activation may facilitate and accelerate peripheral nerve repair. Thymoquinone (TQ), a bioactive component of Nigella sativa seeds, has an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties. In the present study, the neuroprotective efficacy of TQ was investigated by using a laser microdissection technique in a mouse PNI model.\nMETHODS: Single cells were isolated from dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) of 6-8-week-old mice, maintained in defined culture conditions and treated with or without TQ at different concentrations. Axons were cut (axotomy) using a controllable laser microbeam to model axonal injury in vitro. Under fluorescence microscopy, cell viability was evaluated using the fluorescent dyes. The behavior of the cells was continuously monitored with time-lapse video microscopy.\nRESULTS: TQ significantly increased neuronal survival by promoting the survival and proliferation of SCs and fibroblasts, as well as the migration of SCs. Furthermore, TQ improved the ability to extend neurites of axotomized neurons. The regenerative effect of TQ was dose-dependent suggesting a target specificity. Our studies warrant further preclinical and clinical investigations of TQ as a potential regenerative agent to treat peripheral nerve injuries.\nCONCLUSION: TQ exhibits a regenerative potential for the treatment of damaged peripheral nerves."}

We found the marina and fuel docks, met with the management of the thing to get permission to buy some fuel and did just that. They didn’t even have any potable (drinking) water at the dock. (so they said). Turns out it is harder than you would think to find potable water from a hose. Normally, there is drinking water accessible via a water hose just like you have attached to your house. There isn’t a fee for the water since you are purchasing fuel. But we found that once we left Puerto Vallarta, we couldn’t find water until we were so far south that we were almost to Guatamala.

{"completion": "Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease that over time can cause vertebral fusion in the spine. This fusion makes the spine less flexible and can lead to a curved posture forward. When the ribs are touched, it can be difficult to breathe deeply. Ankylosing spondylitis affects men more than women. Signs and symptoms usually begin in early adulthood. Inflammation can also occur in other parts of the body, most often in the eyes. Ankylosing spondylitis cannot be cured, but treatments can reduce their symptoms and possibly delay the progression of the disease. It is a type of arthritis which especially affects the spine. Mostly men at their teen age get attack by this disease.\nIts actual causing reason is still unknown. But it is hypothesized that some genes like HLA-B27 may be responsible for developing this disease."}

Featuring the voices of Christopher Lloyd, Kelly Ripa, Nicollette Sheridan, Tim Curry, Ed Begley Jr., Robert Patrick, and others, the film’s over-reliance on what they felt was a fascinating and relatable children’s plot involving the young insects bogs down the film which would have benefited greatly by focusing exclusively on the astronauts.\nThis is especially apparent as it seems both completely awkward and like some strange “surprise party” styled prank on the audience in the film’s conclusion when heroic Buzz Aldrin himself walks out during the end titles to discredit every single thing that had transpired in the fictitious animated adventure, most likely to distance NASA from what can truly be called a cinematic waste of “space.” So, in other words, grab a swatter and some bug spray as that'll teach kids to imagine that houseflies have \"the right stuff.\""}

But there are always worries that go along with a season that makes you think of love – does he like me, is he being faithful, do we spend enough time together? Honestly, the only solution to all of these problems is to lock him up and tie him to a chair to make sure you two will be together… FOREVER!\nMoving on from all of the tsundere, we are happy to introduce another original character, Yuukin Aikyou. She is just like any other girl – caring, loving, sweet and will make sure that she does whatever is necessary to keep you two together. Hear that? Whatever is necessary. Yanderes are most commonly characterized by their crazy side, be it in love or otherwise. Check out this 4koma for a first hand example.\nWatch out, because Yuu is possessive of everything. But our yandere, Yuukin, did not gain this personality by chance. Her father was often away on business trips which left her mother always alone. To make matters worse, her mother did not understand Japanese and ended up ostracized from her community due to her foreign appearance. Over the years she developed a tendency to go into hysterical fits of depression and anxiety because of her isolation. All the meanwhile, their daughter grew up with misaligned values and a warped idea of what love is.

The machine comes with an additional cable which allows you to massage two people at the same time or to use 4 pads or 6 pads on your body at the same time. The controller runs off a lithium battery that does not need to be replaced and once fully charged will give you 15 plus massage hours. The device works on a frequency of 1 to 100 MHz.\nThe massage pads are designed to send bioelectrical pulses through the body to effectively ease the pain and fatigue of the area. They are easily applied around the body and is very practical for those who sit behind a computer or desk all day.

{"completion": "Military architectural designs are often overlooked in vernacular architecture due to the widespread use of standardized plans at military installations. However, factors including climate in certain regions force the development of new designs for military bases that are better suited to local conditions. This is arguably the case for the Panama Houses of the former Charleston Navy Yard, which are an example of a vernacular building type imported from a foreign context. While scholars have looked from a broad perspective at the Navy Yard and the more prominent structures, no study has been completed considering the history and form of the Panama House. Bringing together architectural evidence from this group of buildings and U.S. housing in the former Panama Canal Zone, this study explores the origins of the Panama House and the factors that brought it to Charleston, ultimately positioning this vernacular form within the context of the region and United States military installations."}

The public is loath to think that the cesarean section being performed on a loved one results from the physician needing to make a boat payment rather than patient need. The doctors, of course, blame the lawyers claiming that lawsuits make the doctors do more cesarean sections to protect themselves from litigation. In an interesting new study available from the Social Science Research Network, MIT and University of British Columbia researchers analyzed records of births in California and Texas and have found that when the patient is a physician she is 10% less likely to receive a c-section delivery. The authors conclude that financial incentives are most likely responsible for this behavior.\nPost a Comment to \"New Study suggests doctors do more cesarean sections because of money.

The full presentation can be found on The statistics that have been published section of this website.\nIn April 2014, the Director of Public Health Science at NHS Health Scotland and two Professors of Public Health wrote to NRS, to ask it to match the ethnic information that was provided when deaths were registered in 2012 with what was recorded in the 2011 census for the same people, in order to assess the accuracy of the information that was recorded at death registration (and also to carry out similar work in respect of later years’ deaths, in order to obtain an ongoing measure of the quality of the data).\nThe data linkage part of this project was the first such piece of work done by the newly-established Data Sharing and Linkage Service, which is now part of the Scottish Informatics and Linkage Collaboration. As a ‘pilot’ project, it took much longer than would now be the case because of the need to establish various sets of rigorous governance, administrative arrangements and technical procedures. Not until May 2016 could NRS link together the ethnicity data from the death registration records for 2012 (and 2013 and 2014) and from the Census records (if any) for those people. A report on the results of the analysis was published on 14 March 2017.\nThe report concluded that the data on the ethnicity of the deceased person were not (at present) suitable for calculating reliable mortality rates for most ethnicities. It identified some ways that NRS could try to improve the quality of future data. The full report is available in The quality of the data for 2012 to 2014 section of this website."}

The hoops can be side-to-side in the front and rear, or front-to-back on each side. You connect the hoops together to increase the overall rigidity of your rack.\nThe primary bracket of the rack system is the corner bracket.

Rack uprights can also be bolted directly to the side of frames and trailer boxes.\nBegin by determining the shape and size of your rack. I do this by sketching planned rack. Then use the sketch to figure out the number of bracket needed and tube lengths.\nOnce you have received your brackets, the first step is cutting your piece to size. This could be done with a hack saw, but that would take some time. A better way to cut your tubing is using a 4.5” angle grinder with a cutoff wheel attached.\nAfter you have your tubing cut to length, lay the piece out on the floor the way they go together.\nThen going one section at a time, position the brackets at the joint positions, square the joints up and mark the bracket holes.\nThen painting can be as simple as a quick scuff up with 220 sandpaper, a wipe down with something like xlyene to clean and a coat or two of enamel rattle can paint.\nFinally, assemble everything with 5/16” x 2 1/4″ bolt, load up whatever you plan to load on your rack and get out for some fun."}

SurfaceScapes puts an interactive map on the Surface, which you can interact with by moving around specially designed miniatures. All of the rules you need to run the game (e.g. movement, powers, etc.) are built into the game, and you can interact with your character through a handheld device (e.g. an iPod touch or smart phone).\nPutting aside snide comments about 4E finally realizing its video game roots, I think this is pretty darn cool. As a GM, I love the idea of using Campaign Cartographer to create rich, beautiful maps, complete with sound effects and event-triggered background music, but it’s hard to pull off in the real world (not impossible, just challenging).\nSomething like SurfaceScapes could let you do all that, while simultaneously abstracting away all those crunchy RPG rules (as we already do every time we fire up Dragon Age, Fallout or Mass Effect). I think games like D&D (be it 3.x or 4.x) led themselves to this sort of digitization, and I could see the hobby moving in this direction someday.\nBut (and you knew there had to be one) … there’s a real problem with cost. These Microsoft Surface units cost upwards of $12,500 (see Wikipedia for cost estimates) making them unrealistic for most people’s weekly game, and putting them out of reach of most hobby stories.\nI also wouldn’t really want this to replace my conventional game — I like using my imagination for all of this, regardless of how cumbersome the rules can be at times. But would I rent one for an afternoon at my local super arcade? You bet."}

A multi-day celebration of our country’s independence, RW&TB features numerous events, concerts and one of the best fireworks shows in the nation. The festival is family-oriented with many events geared toward kids like chalk drawing and ice cream eating contests, a bike parade and a community fair and barbecue featuring carnival games, music and food. Other events include pancake breakfasts, a hometown parade, a veterans tribute and a wine and cheese tasting. Various bands and musicians play around town, and there’s one big concert every year at the main stage on the Village Green (past acts have included Elvin Bishop, Billy Ray Cyrus and Grand Funk Railroad). The highlight of the whole celebration is when the Reno Philharmonic takes the stage as fireworks light up the sky, synchronized with the music. Incline Village’s homespun Red, White and Tahoe Blue celebration has been rated one of the 10 best in the nation, and the fireworks rate in the top five. Many of the events are free but some have an entry fee.

The couple went back to her place in the evening.\nNew reports contain Swift house hunting in London, indicating that the singer wants to be closer to her new beau as reported by Metro. It is rumored before that the singer and her new beau has been living together in London for months to know each other more. A source also said that Taylor and Joe are \"really serious and this is the latest sign that she has really fallen hard for him\".\nTheir story is believed to have started months before the public discovered it on mid-May. Gigi Hadid and Selena Gomez seem to also be in good terms with Joe and support the couple. So is Taylor Swift planning to settle down? Fans might see her wearing an engagement ring one day, and with the seriousness of her relationship with Alwyn right now, this is not far from reality. Swift might have found her Prince Charming at last."}

So he does his neighbor a favor and gives the dirty A4 a proper clean.\nI’m not sure about you but there’s something so satisfying to me about watching these sorts of videos. Watching the process of applying all of the products, letting them soak and seeing the grime simply melt away, then seeing everything get power-washed away and seeing the final clean product is almost therapeutic.\nIt doesn’t hurt that the car in this video is white, which looked really dirty and gross prior to the wash. Afterward, though, it was glistening and looked fantastic. Even just a simple diesel-powered Audi A4 in a pretty basic spec looked like something truly special after its thorough cleaning.\nThe products used are also really impressive and shows how far car-care products have come. Gone are the days when I was a young enthusiast of just getting a bucket of water, some soap and the garden hose. Now, there are so many awesome cleaning products that really melt away grime and make the car truly clean.\nMy only issue with cleaning cars this nicely is that I feel like they shouldn’t be driven afterwards. They look so sparkly clean, I don’t want to think about how dirty they’ll get after one drive in the rain and then all of that hard work is gone.

Printing prayers on condoms satisfies nobody.\nIn all countries, in all centuries, the primary reason for government to set up schools is to undermine the politically weak by convincing their children that the leaders are good and their policies are wise. The core is religious intolerance. The sides simply change between the Atheists, Catholics, Protestants, Unitarians, etc., depending whether you are talking about the Soviet Union, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, America, etc. A common second reason is to prepare the boys to go to war and the girls to cheer them on.\nThe Left/Right scale is a misleading way of comparing political systems.

{"completion": "I finally watched Objectified, one of Gary Hustwit’s Design Film Trilogy, which is about the world of design, particularly industrial design. It explores our complex relationship between “manufactured” everyday objects and the designers. The designers who re-examine, re-evaluate and re-invent our manufactured environment on a daily basis.\nThrough in-depth conversation with the most influential designers in the world, it reminds me of the thing we use every day, that we barely think about, have been designed by someone, with more or less, thought.\nI wouldn’t call myself a designer. I think I prefer to call myself a maker because I usually make things that are not necessarily functional. Regardless of that, the film was very inspiring because I believe that art/craft/design is another form of language, which is a visual tool to communicate with others. Every individual who interacts with an object adds their own interpretation and meaning and it creates a unique connection between a maker, an object and a user. From my perspective, I think memories or emotional links between objects and viewers/users make objects become alive.\nHere is Dieter Rams, a German industrial designer’s a list of 10 essentials for good design.\nGood design should be innovative design.\nGood design should make a product useful."}

In time it will develop robust black curved to hooked spines.\nOrigin and Habitat: Cachipampa (Province of Salta).\nDescription: Echinopsis haematantha var. kuehnrichii best known as Lobivia kuehnrichii, is generally included within (as a synonym of) Echinopsis haematantha that is a very variable cactus species showing a large range of natural variability, especially the colour of the flower. The var. kuehnrichii (sometime misspelled \"kuehnrichiana\") distinguishes for its slightly smaller solitary, rarely clustering body with long black hooked spines. The flowers range in colour from red to orange and yellow with usually a white throat circle.\nStem: Globular to oval, with about 12 (or more) ribs.\nCentral spines: 1 to 4, curved to hooked, black to grey.\nFlowers: Red, orange, or yellow with usually a white throat circle (rarely green). Tube olive green. Stigma sometimes green or yellowish white, rarely carmine.\nTaxonomic note: Some authors place Echinopsis haematantha var. kuehnrichii as a synonim of Echinopsis chrysantha.\nCultivation and Propagation: It is a summer-growing species that offers no cultivation difficulty. Water regularly in summer (but do not over-water). It needs good drainage and very porous soil. Keep rather dry in winter. Feed with a high potassium fertilizer in summer. It is quite frost resistant if kept dry (hardy to -5° C). Outside full sun or afternoon shade, inside it needs bright light, and some direct sun."}

Unlike ducks, coots bring their food to the surface before eating it; this results in frequent cases of food stealing (4). They are opportunistic birds, and may feed in grasslands at certain times of the year (6). During winter, large flocks may gather on large lakes and reservoirs (10), these gatherings are relatively peaceful compared to the fierce territorial aggression seen during the breeding season (2). The nest, a mound of dead reeds, is usually built amongst emergent vegetation (6). From mid-March, between 6 and 9 speckled eggs are laid (occasionally up to 15 eggs, though these large clutches may be laid by more than one female (10)). The eggs are incubated by both parents for up to 24 days (6). The chicks leave the nest a few days after hatching, and reach independence at around 8 weeks of age (6). Two broods are produced a year, but occasionally a third brood may occur (6).\nSeen from the train between Airport and center.\nswampy areas near railway station.

But that is not an option, Lew said.\nAsked about the possibility of a federal response to Detroit’s recent bankruptcy declaration, Lew threw cold water on any chances the struggling city will get federal aid.\n“Detroit is going to have to work with its creditors on this,” Lew told ABC."}

{"completion": "Mohd Sayuti, M. Norazizi Sham (2014) Early Design Space Exploration of Hard Real-Time Embedded Networks-on-Chip. PhD thesis, University of York.\nNetworks-On-Chip (NoC) is seen as a solution for addressing the limitation of the current bus-based communication in embedded systems. Some of these systems are designed for executing hard real-time services. In such systems, the services have to deliver output within strict timing constraints since the lateness in output delivery could cause severe consequences to human life. Task mapping is a crucial step for integrating an application and a hardware platform during system design. Existing schedulability analyses are available to evaluate the hard real-time performance of task mapping, but exploring the vast number of task mappings at the early design stage can be challenging due to several issues. These issues are caused by the influence of other design parameters on the hard real-time performance produced by task mapping, the existence of conflicting design objectives with the hard real-time system constraints, the restriction of the current hard real-time evaluation functions for searching alternative task mappings and the enormous evaluation of population-based search heuristics in the current task mapping techniques. This thesis proposes several design space exploration techniques to address these issues. The first technique is proposed for addressing the problem of optimising multiple design parameters while keeping all tasks and messages in the system fully schedulable. The second technique addresses the conflicting objectives problem using a multi-objective optimisation approach. The third technique yields a new metric that is useful for improving task mappings with unschedulable tasks and messages. Finally, the last technique is a new mapping algorithm for constructing a feasible task mapping rather than have to evaluate a population of task mappings to achieve the same objective."}

Chanda could answer yes…but she chooses not to. Instead, she has chosen to overcome with a smile when there is nothing to smile about and give to others out of her poverty. Amidst the dreary circumstances she calls life, Chanda’s beauty and strength rises higher.\nChanda lives in Sermapore, India with her parents and six siblings where one bed sleeps all the children. Her father is a rickshaw driver and her mother is a maid. Together they barely bring home enough money to feed their family of 10 with rotted food. Her father usually returns from work drunk and abusive. If these circumstances were not grim enough, Chanda was born with Cardiomegaly, commonly known as an enlarged heart. Her condition causes shortness of breath and extreme fatigue keeping Chanda from basic tasks, but also from her passion – dancing. Without surgery, her condition would eventually cause an early death.\nBut, the heart surgery Chanda needed would never have been a possibility for this family except for the work of Calcutta Mercy Ministries. Through this ministry, Chanda received heart surgery at no cost to her family. Now, she is able to live without slowing down or avoiding certain activities due to her weak heart…she is even free to dance. Each of us can give wings to a child in need by giving them a chance to overcome their circumstances too.\n*All net proceeds from “Overcome” will be used to medically treat children in need through Calcutta Mercy Ministries."}

The tool I don’t have yet is a froe, which is used to split out blanks from a round log and a shaving horse will make the process easier, but not required. I have a draw knife that might be older than me so I do have to figure out how to sharpen it.\nMy plan is to cut lengths at about 6′, 4′ and 2′ and split out some handle blanks. This will cover the lengths of everything from a rake or hoe to a hammer. They will need to be seasoned of course and that means coating the ends so they don’t dry to quickly and cause the wood to split. There is something called Anchorseal that the lumber industry uses to for this purpose, but hobbyist also just use exterior grade latex paint.\nHaving a stock of handle material air-drying is an investment that every homesteader should do it they can. From what amounts to a chunk of firewood you can get a valuable resource for next to no money. Consider it an investment in future tool needs."}

We've shown up to 16 homes in one day but generally 6-8 is a good number.\nFinancing is a major step in buying your home. We work with several lenders. We will ask you to get qualified early in the process. There is little to be gained by getting your hopes up about buying a home if you can't get financing. This is a critical step in the process. A prequalification letter can be done in a day or two. It is wise to have this early. Some sellers require that you have the letter prior to submitting an offer.\nOur team will work hard to find the right home at the right price. We won't hesitate to suggest you walk away if we believe it is not in your best interest.

{"completion": "7th September 1914, Luton: White feathers have been sent to young single men in Luton who have not enlisted. Some of the sillier girls have been convinced by what they read in the papers that any young man not in uniform is an unpatriotic shirker. They do not seem to realise that with so many men joining the army even some former soldiers are finding it difficult to re-enlist. One young man who had served as an officer in the Territorials tried to rejoin his battalion as soon as the war began. The battalion was at full strength and he has been waiting for a commission in another regiment. He would be happy to join the ranks, but has heard that new Territorial battalions are being formed and hopes to be needed by one of them. Despite this he received a white feather in the post. It may also be that single men have family responsibilities, caring for parents or siblings, or are not fit enough to be accepted into the Forces. They say that although Lord Kitchener asked for 200,000 men to join up, over 300,000 have now enlisted and the War Office does not have the resources to equip or train all the new recruits. Even if there were cause to believe a young man may be shirking his duty and to tell him so with a white feather, it would surely be better to give it to him personally and give him a chance to explain himself rather than to take the coward’s course and send a feather anonymously."}

{"completion": "Rochester Webelos Cub Scouts were lucky to be able to participate in maple syrup making in Rochester, MA last month. Our neighbor, Wendy Keeler invited us over to watch the process. She taps red maples rather than sugar maples since that is what is available in our area. The maple syrup has a great taste, a little more vanilla flavor, than traditional syrup from sugar maples. She had 11 tapped trees on her property and the cold nights and relatively warm days provided overflowing jugs of sap. The boys watched as she boiled the sap from the trees outside over a arch system fire. The boiling releases a lot of steam so boiling outside is preferable. The boys were surprised to learn that it takes 40 gallons of sap to make 1 gallon of syrup. It also takes 24 hours to boil the thin sap into a thick syrup. We got a taste of the finished product and it was delicious.\nWe also brought a 5 gallon bucket of sap home, thanks to Wendy, and boiled it down to one mason jar worth of syrup. It took 24 hours but it was worth every minute. The syrup was delicious. We are definitely rationing it to make it last as long as possible.

{"completion": "If we are permitted to be Christians, this has its profound meaning and purpose and springs from God's eternal thoughts about us (Jeremiah 31:3). God has drawn us to Him out of pure goodness, compassion and mercy. We are now earnestly requested to humbly approach this incomprehensible Creator, as a people permitted to belong to God. We are not at eye-level height with the Almighty, but only those pardoned who still do not conceive the depth of this concept. We have no cause to think that we can approach God in any other manner, but in humility and respectful fear of God. God is not our mate. Who can fathom HIM? If we approach God with this Biblically-desired attitude, then God will reveal Himself to us and gladly have to do with us. And beyond that, He will also supply our living needs. To this it is written in Matthew 6:33 ''But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.'' God's righteousness is His grace, revealed to the world through Jesus Christ. God became human because no-one out of his own asked for God. The grace always comes from above, not from below! The Kingdom of God came to us – and many have twisted it around and haughtily mocked everything which was holy and precious to God. This is still true today. But, if we have faith, then this applies especially to us: Humble yourself before the LORD and HE will lift you up! In Jude 20-21 we read: “But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.” God is Light and Life (Ephesians 5:8) and God is indeed that which humans are not, in comparison they appear merely as a “baffled wind” (Psalm 78:39) – HE on the other hand is: Meek and humble of heart (Matthew 11:29). Amen.\nNext devotion: Are you coming to the party?"}

{"completion": "I made this card some time ago and I wasn't sure if I wanted to upload it or not. I'm not that crazy about how it turned out, but it took me so long to make I just couldn't throw it away. I originally made this card for my daughter to send to her cousin who just happens to love frogs.\nMy cloud background was created using a punched scallop circle and a blue inked sponge. I simple sponged around the scalloped part and then moving the scallop circle I sponged again.\nMy grassy area was also sponged using old olive ink. I simply inked up the sponge and randomly sponged all over the lower part of my card base (I didn't use the punched scallop circle for this part).\nJust about everything else was stamped, cut out, and then I placed it onto my card. The cutting was the most time consuming part of my card. I stamped the flies directly on my card and then I stamped and cut out another fly. I placed the cut out fly right on top of the one that I had stamped on my card base (except for the wings). I left them unattached to my card base so that I could pick up the wings a bit. Then I placed some DD glitter onto each of the fly's wings.\nThe lily pad was stamped twice, but I cut off the cattails on one of the images. I used my chocolate chip marker to color in the two cattails. The logs were just stamped and cut out as well as the frogs. The sentiment reads- time's fun when you're having flies.\nThanks for stopping by! I'll be posting a CAS Christmas card tomorrow, have a wonderful day!\nOh Patty,I Can't see where you went wrong on this card.I love it.The scenery is soooo cute.Very creative.\nThis is darling Patty. What a great little scene you created.\nThis is SO fun and perfect! I love the little frogs leaping around trying to catch flies. I love how you created 3D glittery wings for the flies! Beautiful sponging on the grass and sky, too!"}

{"completion": "Dimethyl ether (DME) is a non-toxic fuel with high H/C ratio and high volumetric energy density, and could be served as an ideal source of H2/syngas production for application in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). This study presents results of DME partial oxidation over a 1.5 wt% Pt/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalyst under the condition of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 15000-60000 ml/(g·h), molar ratio of O2/DME of 0.5 and 500-700 °C, and this temperature range was also the operation temperature range for intermediate temperature SOFC. The results indicated that the catalyst showed good activity for the selective partial oxidation of DME to H2/syngas. Under the working conditions investigated, DME was completely converted. Increase in reaction temperature enhanced the amount of syngas, but lowered the H2/CO ratio and yield of methane; while increase in reaction GHSV resulted in only slight variation in the distribution of products. The good catalytic activity of Pt supported on Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 for the partial oxidation of DME may be directly associated with the good oxygen storage capacity of the support, which is worth of further investigation to develop materials for application in SOFC. © 2008 CAS/DICP.\nChen, Y. and Shao, Z. and Xu, N. 2008.

{"completion": "First, Lee shows the difference in intelligence and work ethic between Atticus and Bob Ewell. Atticus Finch is an educated, highly intellectual man who works for the state. “Atticus met [Scout and Jem’s mother] when he was first elected to the state legislature.” (7) We know he has formal schooling because you must be educated to be elected to most offices. Atticus is hard working, and his job helps the community therefore they value him, whereas the town often comment on how they haven't seen the Ewell’s do one honest day of work. Bob Ewell is an ignorant drunk who has eight kids and no job. His intellectual capacity is nowhere near that of Atticus Finch’s. Judge Taylor is forced to read the riot act to the spectators in the courtroom following Bob Ewell's accusation and “The judge cautioned Bob, too, but Mr. Ewell reminded [Scout] of a deaf-mute. [She] was sure he had never heard the words that Judge Taylor directed at him.” (233) Bob Ewell can’t comprehend half of what people say to him and isn’t very intelligent. Because of this contrast in intellectual capacity, Atticus and Bob are on very different levels of understanding, which is sure to create conflict sooner or later.\nDialogue Essays: Do Vampires Really Exist?\nThe Day of the Sale...

State Science Standards are intended to be a foundation for local curriculum and not a limit of what district's can do.\nThe process for developing the Kansas Science Education Standards has been very difficult since 1999. In 2004, the writing process of the committee was stopped in the middle of the development of the standards, leaving an unfinished flawed document.

{"completion": "HB2 - Hypobromous Acid - Enviro Tech Chemical Services, Inc.\nThe use of Hypobromous Acid is a patented antimicrobial product approved by the FDA-FSIS for use on meat and poultry during processing and is Kosher certified. It is similar to chlorine (hypochlorous acid) in many ways, but with some very distinct advantages.\nHypobromous Acid is stable and effective in pH ranges of 5-9, and therefore does not require acid adjustment, which is necessary for chlorine-based products.\nHypobromous Acid combines with organic compounds to form a bromamine. Chlorine also combines with the same organic compounds to form a chloramine. However, bromamines are 50-100 times more potent biocides than a chloramine, so bromine is a far superior biocide in the presence of organic matter.\nHypobromous Acid is one of the least expensive intervention antimicrobial compounds available."}

{"completion": "Yes, we have German roots, too. Polka and Oktoberfest with us. Explore more.\nSan Antonio’s culture is diverse. And yes, we have German heritage, too. In the 1840’s, a group of German noblemen formed a group called the Adelsverein to protect German immigrants coming to Texas and to secure land for them in the Texas Hill Country. Today, that land includes visitor favorites like the towns of Fredericksburg, Comfort, Boerne and New Braunfels.\nGerman immigrants also moved to San Antonio. One such immigrant was Carl Hilmar Guenther, founder of Pioneer Flour Mills. In 1860, he built an elegant home nestled between his mill and the San Antonio River, now known as the Guenther House — a favorite for brunch along the RIver Walk.\nAlso, in the late 1800’s, the King William neighborhood was settled by other prominent German merchants. Today, it’s the state’s first zoned historic district and one of the most stylish residential areas in the city."}

{"completion": "Are E-cigarettes Leading More Kids to Smoke?\nToday, thanks to decades of educational efforts about the serious health consequences of inhaled tobacco, fewer young people than ever smoke cigarettes in the United States. So, it’s interesting that a growing of number of middle and high school kids are using e-cigarettes—electronic devices that vaporize flavored liquid that generally contains nicotine.\nE-cigarettes come with their own health risks, including lung inflammation, asthma, and respiratory infections. But their supporters argue that “vaping,” as it’s often called, might provide an option that would help young people steer clear of traditional cigarettes and the attendant future risks of lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease, and other serious health conditions. Now, a new NIH-funded study finds that this is—pardon the pun—mostly a pipe dream.\nAnalyzing the self-reported smoking behaviors of thousands of schoolkids nationwide, researchers found no evidence that the availability of e-cigarettes has served to accelerate the decline in youth smoking. In fact, the researchers concluded the opposite: the popularity of e-cigarettes has led more kids—not fewer—to get hooked on nicotine, which meets all criteria for being an addictive substance."}

Currently run by Bernard and Olivier Coste. Based in the Languedoc region of Southern France. The Domaine Montrose coat of arms of three lizards has become the logo used on all of their wines. The name Montrose refers to its geographic location on a volcano (Mont) and to the pink (Rose) flowers from the almond trees surrounding the vineyard. The vineyard is located around the domaine on the “Côtes de Thôngue” terroir in the Mediterranean southern France. They encourage sustainable farming of their 85 hectares in the belief that it protects the environment but also better expresses the local terroir in the wines. There are 3 types of soil volcanic, chalky clay and siliceious-clay gravel. They are able to cultivate local and foreign grape varieties from Rolle to Cabernet Sauvignon, vinify them and then produce beautifully married blends. Fully thermo-controlled steel tanks are used for fermenting and ageing all of the cepages. Wines produced include Chardonnay, Viognier, Rose, Merlot Syrah, Cabernet Syrah. They produce a blended range of red, white and rose wines called La Balade and their prestige wine is called Salamandre. Its 2012 Rose won a silver award at the Decanter World Wine Awards in 2013.\nAlmost akin to a white, the wines in this category feature the Gamay grape from Beaujolais. Tend to be pale red in colour with refreshing redcurrant and red berry fruit flavours. Great at lunchtime or served slightly chilled in the summer. Will go down well with non-red wine drinkers."}

But its hard to explain why, and it might not be even Windows 10’s fault.\nOn-screen keyboard doesn’t pop up automatically for Firefox, but does for Edge (Surface Pro 3 in tablet mode). One assumes because Edge is an Universal App?\nTraditional Chinese keyboard doesn’t display candidate list automatically; you have to press down-arrow every time to see the complete list. That is 1/4 to 1/3 more keystrokes per Chinese character!\nPressing the touchscreen for any action (e.g. close windows, ‘Ok’ button etc) has a minute but discernible lag, especially if you are used to an iPad. Two finger touchscreen scrolling is great though. Does this lie with Win10 or Surface Pro 3?\nOr maybe I’m just a grumpy old man set in my ways. I will seriously mourn the day Microsoft stops supporting Windows 7.\nIts finally finished. Windows Update has been calculating which updates to apply since 9am. So that’s more than 6 hours to calculate – now comes the actual update part.\nFair enough, this is a fresh reinstall of Windows 7 on a relic of a CPU: AMD Athlon x2. But its desktop class and not RAM constrained.\nI reckon Windows Update should be the real-world metric to assess how fast a system is. Sure, this way of measuring has a big flaw, since new updates are constantly available so updating at different times will produce different results. Regardless, it’ll still be a good-enough rough measure of how a system would perform for the average person using the PC in real life."}

{"completion": "Coruscation: Can Tesla be agile to make cars ?\nCan Tesla be agile to make cars ?\nWhat many people enamored with the idea of agile fail to realize is where the limits are. Agile is efficient when the cost of making a change is lower than the cost of an iteration. In other words, your iterations have to be profitable (at least in aggregate.).\nDeploying software to a server costs almost nothing, so you can iterate every five minutes and make money. Except when you make a mistake and deploy something broken, which can cost you in damaged customer reputation. In many cases these are costs that can be absorbed, but fail too often and the product is doomed.\nAgile works by holding time and effort constant, but letting scope vary. That means using agile techniques to handle hardware projects where scope can't vary (like deploying routers to remote sites) can fail much more easily. If any component is delayed, the whole product is delayed, and other expenses rise: rescheduling installers often has a cascading effect on the rest of the project."}

This style has absolutely come to stay and it is fast and now a staple for a stylish man.

I don't know if it has a hot water tank by-pass or if they put 6 Gal. of anti-freeze in the tank, I think there has to be a lot of unanswered questions, from visual indications it looks like it is worth the $6,500 he is asking. but I sure don't want to get in over my head with a lot of costly problems from the Casita just sitting idle four years, What are some of the things I should look for, if any one has any knowledge or experience or just suggestions along these lines I would certainly appreciate your thoughts.\ni got into trouble with that when i switched from a full size trucks---there is much crazy discussion about what i went thru but there is one good thread on tow weight in the real world that might help.\nDefinitely worth taking with you.\nGet under it, check for frame rust, cracks, etc.\nUsed glass trailers tend to see quickly if they are in good shape so don't ponder to long it it's a gem!\nSorry meant to type, IF its a gem!

On the 3rd June 2015, Prof. Paul Smits, Dean Radboudumc, signed an agreement with Joan Guinovart, Director of IRB. This umbrella agreement paves the way for further strengthening of existing exchanges and exploring new opportunities for collaboration.\nHigh-quality research is a corner-stone of the Radboudumc covering research from molecule to man to population. It is within this academic hospital setting that RIMLS works to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and ultimately to develop tools for “Personalized Healthcare”. In his opening speech, Paul Smits noted the motto of IRB, ‘The medicine of the future starts here’. “I presume ‘here’, could also mean Nijmegen and not just Barcelona!” Present-day science tackles the most complex problems that usually cannot be solved by single researchers or even single institutions. Forming sustainable, interactive networks of scientists across international borders is indispensable for conceptual breakthroughs and translation of fundamental findings into clinical practice.\nConfirmed in a second contract signed by the directors of the programmes, from next year, IRB Masters students will be able to participate in our Molecular mechanisms of Disease (MMD) training. It is a huge boost that a third party institute has such confidence in the quality of our research and education. Furthermore, PhD students will visit be able to visit each other’s centers, and PIs will be invited for seminars. We will also look at the possibility of joint grant applications. Finally, we intend to invite IRB top researchers to apply for the RU Excellence program and/or Radboudumc Hypatia fellowship programme.\nThe visit of the IRB delegation was very positive, setting a concrete basis for further cooperation between our institutions."}

After he moved to Brooklyn, Dmitriy was exposed to orthodox Judaism and became an observant Jew. He strictly follows Jewish law – if he has a fight on a Saturday, it must begin after sundown, the end of the sabbath. Dmitriy said, “Anyone who wants a good whuppin’ from me is just going to have to wait until sundown.” There are as many as 70 Jewish holy days on which he will not fight, and he follows Jewish dietary laws. When he’s training, he stays within walking distance of a synagogue for Friday and Saturday services – he’s not allowed to drive on the sabbath.\nHe started boxing at the age of 13 at the Starrett City Boxing Club, which is run by Jimmy O’Pharrow; Jimmy said, “My gym’s like a league of nations. I seen every kind of kid come through the doors, but I ain’t never seen one like this Dmitriy. Kid looks Russian, prays Jewish and fights black.”…Dmitriy said, “Jimmy runs an old school gym, a ghetto gym. My style isn’t European. It isn’t even American. It’s a city style. It’s black. I don’t know how else to say it. But some of us white boys got it like that.”…the radio at Starrett was always tuned to HOT 97; Dmitriy described it as “Blasting. A lot of Biggie. A lot of Tupac.

Tom Carper (D-Del.), the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) of 2019 would reauthorize the program at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency through 2024 to assist firms with rebuilding or retrofitting diesel engines. The objective is for those updated engines to be able to comply with pollution standards.\nThe Environment and Public Works panel advanced the measure to the floor of the Senate by voice vote. Carper, the panel’s ranking Democrat, had initially authored the bill more than a decade ago with former Ohio Sen. George Voinovich (R).\n“With today’s vote, we’re one step closer to making sure this bipartisan tradition, imagined and incepted by my dear friend Sen. Voinovich, will continue to boost economic growth and encourage environmental progress,” Carper added. Voinovich died in 2016.\nCo-sponsors of the bill include committee Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), as well as Republican Sens. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, along with Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.\nSenate floor managers have yet to schedule a floor vote for the bill. In March, a bipartisan group of House lawmakers unveiled their version.\n“This is a critical piece of legislation that helps address the climate crisis and makes our diesel cars and trucks more fuel efficient,” said Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, sponsoring the House version.\nEPA is tasked with distributing DERA grants. It announced that it anticipates awarding about $40 million in competitive grants for its clean diesel funding assistance program.

In slug-prone environments, it is better to forego mulching, and either compost your leaves or manage them in a separate pile to produce leaf mold. Then, use the compost or leaf mold as soil amendments. Should there be slug eggs present in the compost or leaf mold, allowing it to dry in the sun for a few days will kill most of them. This is also a great job for chickens, who happily remove slugs and other creatures from leaf piles."}

{"completion": "I'm running LR Classic on Win10 with plenty of memory and disk space and a decent i7.\nI've created a smallish slideshow (88 files, mix of jpg and raw). It previews OK, but when I export it to 1080p video, the background task just hangs. Judging by the progress bar, it may make it through a few frames, but nothing ever comes out, even if I leave it for a few hours. No music or other fancy stuff.\nSorry to hear you are having trouble. Let's perform a test on your system and see if we can zero in on the problem.. If you grab just 10 files and attempt the same (instead of the full 88 files), will the slide show then execute?\nIt seems to be random, or dependent on some unknown system process. When I originally built the show, it had 86 stills and exported OK. Then I added a video clip in the middle, and it started hanging at that point (judging by the progress bar). I removed the video, and changed a couple of the still images, and after that nothing worked. I did try a smaller subset at the time.\nStrangely, I just went and tried it, and it seems to be working again. Nothing has changed, other than rebooting the computer at some point in the interim (which I had also tried before).\nSo it now works with the video inserted in the middle?\nIt works with the full set of stills - I didn't try reinserting the video. I discovered the limitation, that you can't mute the background music during video clips, so I'm assembling the stills into a silent video and then finishing the edits in Lightworks.\nI can test reinserting the video later.\nReinserting the video now works too. Go figure.\nResetting preferences is definitely a bummer. It nukes LR in all sorts of subtle ways you've forgotten you set up."}

{"completion": "As a part of each STEP module, the students learn about different health issues and translate materials that they can take back to their villages and use to educate others. Today one of the doctors from our clinic came to give a health lesson. We discussed how to know the difference between a common cold in children and pneumonia. Pneumonia is the number one killer of children in Papua New Guinea. However, there is a tendency for many villagers to go to the clinic and ask for “sut marasin” (an antibiotic shot) for any kind of illness that they have. Today the students learned that antibiotics should not be used to treat common colds, and also what signs to look for to know when a child really does need to go to the clinic and get medication.\nWe also learned about tuberculosis and the dangers of smoking. TB is a leading killer of adults in PNG, and so we learned about how it is spread, what the symptoms are and how it can be treated. Smoking is also very common in PNG, and there are common misconceptions. For example, many people believe that only imported, packaged cigarettes will mess up your body, and that the roll-your-own variety have no health consequences.\nFinally, we spent some time talking about cholera. Just this year, Papua New Guinea experienced its first cholera outbreak. It started near a port city and is slowly making inroads to other parts of the country. The students were glad to learn that it is a preventable disease and what steps they could take to protect themselves and their communities."}

{"completion": "CD16 is a 50-65 kDa cell surface molecule that exists in two forms - a transmembranous form expressed by natural killer (NK) cells, and some T cells and a phosphatidylinositol linked form expressed by granulocytes. CD16 is a low affinity receptor for IgG (FcR III), and is an important receptor mediating ADCC (antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity) by NK cells. IN comparison, CD32 is a 40 kD glycoprotein that acts as a low affinity receptor for IgG (also known as Fc gamma RII), and mediates several functions including endocytosis, activation of secretion, cytotoxicity and immunomodulation. CD32 is expressed by B cells, monocytes, granulocytes and platelets. Further, CD32 is involved in the phagocytosis of immune complexes, the regulation of antibody production by B-cells, and variations of the CD32 gene may increase vulnerability to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms of CD32 have been found."}

Which is the first major sell off I have seen in a while.\nWith the situation over at Greece, and from what I understand a few other potential European countries, a “dash of shorts spice” was thrown into the markets.\nOver the past few years, most short-term selloffs turned out to be a buying opportunity, but as they say hindsight is 20/20 vision.\nAs one who got burnt going short on the indices I am trying to be a bit more careful.\nIn order for the Russell to confirm a sell signal based on the weekly chart, I need to see a daily close below 1244. Yesterday was VERY close to it but still closed above it.\nI think that a close below 1244 can trigger 1089 over the next few weeks/months.\nNot an easy scenario to trade with as the memories of short attempts in the past few years not turning into much to say the least….\nOne way one can trade this is by using straight futures and going short on close below 1244. The risk on this one would be quite high as one would need to use a stop above 1280 or maybe even past the recent high above 1292.\nAnother way to go about it (and one can choose stock index of their choice) is to buy a vertical put spread, where you buy a closer to the money put and sell a further out of the money put.\nAs always, certain strategies may be more appropriate for certain traders, depending on their experience, market outlook and risk capital."}

{"completion": "Author: Wolf, Jannic; Huhn, Thomas; Steiner, Ulrich E.\nA recently reported protolytic gating effect on the ring closing reaction of an oligo(phenylene ethynylene) (OPE) embedded difurylperfluorocyclopentene (S) with a dimethylaminophenyl chain link in each of the side arms, was quantitatively analyzed in detail. The reaction system (So, SoH+, SoH22+, Sc' ScH+, ScH22+) comprising three protolytic forms in both open and closed configuration, is characterized by four protolytic equilibrium constants and six photochemical quantum yields of ring closing and ring opening. The absorption spectra, conductivity, and effective photochemical quantum yields were measured in acetonitrile as functions of solvent acidity varied by addition of trifluoroacetic acid and triethylamine and characterized by an effective pHnon-aq. Based on the derivation of a rigorous method for assessing the individual quantum yields of ring closure and ring opening of the six species, it was shown that it is specifically the second protonation step that is responsible for a more than 10-fold increase in the quantum yield of ring closure."}

Kate Gould of the Friends Committee on National Legislation, an expert on the Middle East policy, explains why now is the time for supporters of peace and diplomacy to reassert what the deal the Obama administration struck with Iran has accomplished.\nAs a result of the deal, there have already been more conversations between the U.S. and Iran over other regional conflicts, which is tremendously significant. Now that this diplomatic channel is wider, the U.S. should hold up its end of the bargain and lift more of the economic sanctions against Iran, which can only be done by Congress, Gould says.\nOn this issue, it matters who is in the White House – Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has said ripping up the Iran deal would be among his first actions if he is president – and it matters how much citizen pressure in support of continued diplomacy with Iran is felt by Congress."}

{"completion": "This is the third in a series of six-week-long research workshops on Machine Learning for Speech Language and Computer Vision Technology. These workshops bring together diverse “dream teams” of leading professionals, graduate students, and undergraduates, in a truly cooperative, intensive, and substantive effort to advance the state of the science.\nThese workshops constitute a continuation of the well known Johns Hopkins University summer workshops, and encompasses all areas of human language technology including automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, topic detection and tracking, information retrieval and extraction, summarization and question answering, and certain related areas of computer vision, including image understanding and visual scene analysis. These fields share many important algorithmic and statistical approaches, allowing cross-fertilization. Machine learning challenges that arise from these areas are of fundamental scientific interest, and are shared with many other fields of science and engineering, such as medical-/bio-informatics and social network analysis.\nThe Center for Language and Speech Processing at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) has 20 years of experience with organizing workshops of this kind. JHU will therefore act as an anchor for these workshops, but the actual host institution will rotate from year to year in order to ensure wider community ownership and engagement, and to distribute the organizational burden more widely. The 2014 workshop was hosted at Charles University in Prague, the 2015 workshop was hosted at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA, and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, will be the site of the 2016 workshop."}

Warm sesame bread joins the party, a total lunchtime treat.\nInviting doorways sweeten the air with a stew of dates, figs and cinnamon gently simmering lamb into tender obedience.

But she has now received notification that her application has been turned down because she had not paid the new £500 NHS surcharge.\nMrs Hawkins, who had discretionary leave to remain in the UK and intended to apply for citizenship, said she did not receive the letter from immigration authorities relating to the charge.\nShe had already paid more than £600 applying for her visa and must now resubmit her application or face being deported. She has also been told she cannot work in the UK as her discretionary leave to remain was not renewed. In addition, she must also wait for 10 years before applying for British citizenship, rather than the previous two years.\nMrs Hawkins, who lives in Distington, Cumbria, told the Workington Times and Star: “I just want a fair chance. I have paid all my taxes and national insurance. I have never claimed any benefits even though my visa allowed me to do so.\nShe said she had not received the letter relating to the NHS charge. She is also waiting for the authorities to return her certificate which proves she speaks English, which she needs to resubmit her visa application.\nIf Mrs Hawkins is forced to leave the UK, she will not be allowed to return for a year and if she is deported, she faces a 10-year wait before she can reapply for a visa. The Hawkins family have contacted their MP, Jamie Reed, over the issue and their eldest daughter Kimberley has started an online petition in support of her mother."}

{"completion": "Can Medical Marijuana Actually Assist With Rough Hangovers?\nSpending a night out with your friends is always a good time, but the morning after is not always a bed of roses. Too often, going hard at the club or the bar will result in a massive headache and upset stomach the next day. However, what if there was a way to reduce the effects of a hangover? While there are plenty of products on the market today, one might be the best of them all: medical cannabis. Let’s see what discoveries are being made about this potential cure.\nBefore we can decide if weed can cure this ailment, we first have to understand how it works. After a hard night of drinking, your body requires two things to feel refreshed and get back to normal. First, you need to rehydrate as alcohol saps your body of water. Second, you have to flush all of the toxic chemicals out of your system. Until both of those things happen, you won’t be rid of your hangover.\nWell, it should be clear that smoking a joint will not rehydrate your cells, nor will it expunge the alcohol from your body. So why would it ever be considered a hangover cure? Well, two reasons. First, it helps you feel better, so you are not in as much pain (particularly in your head). Second, it can alleviate your nausea and help you eat and drink. Since water is necessary to beat your hangover, this can be a game changer.\nIf you want the ultimate in convenience, then you should look into getting your weed delivered. After a night of partying, you won’t have the energy or stamina to go to the nearest dispensary. Instead, look for marijuana delivery near me and hit them up for some sweet relief.\nOverall, weed won’t cure your hangover, but it will make it a lot more tolerable. The only thing to remember is to smoke a little bit; it’s never a good idea to be hungover and high.\nWhat Is the Connection Between Ethics and Social Media?"}

Absolutely. In other posts, I’ve listed foods that specifically energize each chakra. But, in general, it’s best to avoid GMO’s, genetically-modified crops such as the corn and soy found in most commercial products. Buying organic products, labeled “non-GMO,” can save you from many health issues that are just coming to light through independent research about Monsanto’s RoundUp and RoundUp-ready, genetically-engineered crops.\nGiven as a token of love on Valentine’s Day, chocolate even loves us back – providing beneficial nutrients like Iron, Calcium, Potassium and Magnesium in addition to vitamins A, E and other antioxidants, dispelling our bad moods and literally providing food for thought by renewing our spirits and launching our meditations.

Section 6056 applies to applicable large employers (ALEs), or those with 50 or more full-time employees, including full-time equivalents, in the previous year.

But prior to that, Khama sparked international outrage when he married a white woman in 1948.

{"completion": "The financial industry greats will be the first to tell you that real estate investing has the potential to bring in serious profits. They will also gleefully inform you that the risks in some cases far outweigh the potential, especially if they are among the more cautious investors in the industry. Those who have made their fortunes in real estate however will tell you that investing in real estate is worth every ounce of risk when you manage to work through the rough patches and find your way to real estate investing fortunes.\nCommercial real estate investing is a bit of a different animal than traditional residential real estate that many of us are more familiar or comfortable with. You will need to do a lot of research before jumping in with both feet with this particular sort of real estate investment. Commercial real estate investments can take on many forms. From strip malls and outright shopping malls to business and industrial complexes to sky scrapers and high rise condos you will find all manner of commercial real estate interests. Whether your interests lie in business or personal types of commercial real estate there are significant profits that stand to be made.\nUnfortunately, beginners often find the path to commercial real estate investing laden with thorns. You will need a massive contribution to fund your commercial real estate pursuits and it is probably best if you can find a group of investors in order to share some of the risks. Real estate, in and of itself, is a high-risk venture. Commercial real estate bears a little more of the risks in the beginning however once you're established and people, particularly investors, know your name you will find that path to real estate wealth is much easier obtained through commercial real estate, if you play your cards right than many other types of real estate investing."}

{"completion": "At a high level of abstraction, a digital or computer file is a stored segment or block of information that is available to a computer program. Files are so named because they are the counterparts of the paper documents traditionally kept in file folders, usually stored in a file cabinet. Computer operating systems consider files as a sequence of bytes, while application software interprets the binary data as, say, text characters, image pixels, or audio samples.\nThis term is comparable to the term file as defined in Introduction and Supporting Materials from PREMIS Data Dictionary (p. 7): \"A file is a named and ordered sequence of bytes that is known by an operating system. A file can be zero or more bytes and has a file format, access permissions, and file system characteristics such as size and last modification date . . . . Files can be read, written, and copied. Files have names and formats.\"\nAlthough this high-level meaning is valid for the Federal Agencies Digitization Initiative, our definition also calls attention to the digital file in relationship to the digital package and the digital package part. Take, for example, the case of a digitally reformatted book or 78 rpm phonodisc. The digital package includes all of the files pertaining to the digitized book or phonodisc. Most reformatting programs will create a set of versioned digital files--perhaps an archival master, a production master, and multiple derivative files--for each book page or disc side (digital item parts). Thus page 3 or side B may be represented by three or four files that meet a variety of objectives."}

{"completion": "There is actually a great deal of crossover between the two words and the items they represent, meaning the terms can be used interchangeably a lot of the time. This arises due to the different ways the words are used as nouns or verbs and, in relation to products such as screws, nails, nuts/bolts etc, difficulties arise unless the word ‘fixing’ is ONLY used as a verb.\nAs always, when there is confusion like this, the best place to head for is the dictionary to get a proper definition. But don’t worry, we have done the research for you!\nFor example, if a joist is securely nailed into a joist hanger, with the use of extra straps for lateral restraint purposes, ‘fixings’ refers to the entire system, inclusive of all straps and connectors. The ‘fasteners’ in this context are the nails. A further example: if a rafter is attached to a wall plate using nails, the ‘fastener’ would be the nails and the ‘fixing’ the nails centres.\nIn most cases, uses the terms interchangeably is not a major issue and you will generally be understood either way. Our original question, about why we are not called BS Fasteners, is that we supply such a wide range of products that it makes more sense to refer to the entire systems we supply rather than individual items. Also, BS Fixings rolls off the tongue much nicer in our opinion!\nWhatever you need to fix, use our fasteners to fix it. We have got everything you could ever require and, if you can’t see it right away, then our expert team will source it for you to ensure that your project can be completed to the most professional standard."}

Even though you try very hard, the progress you make is always little by little. It is not like going out in a shower in which you know when you get wet. In a fog, you do not know you are getting wet, but as you keep walking you get wet little by little. If your mind has ideas of progress, you may say, \"Oh, this pace is terrible!\" But actually it is not. When you get wet in a fog it is very difficult to dry yourself. So there is no need to worry about progress. It is like studying a foreign language; you cannot do it all of a sudden, but by repeating it over and over you will master it. This is the Soto way of practice. We can say either that we make progress little by little, or that we do not even expect to make progress.

{"completion": "Cardamom also known as elaichi, has a wonderful aroma and an enticing warm, spicy-sweet flavour. The whole pods can be added to dishes, or the seeds can be extracted and either added whole or ground. When using cardamom to flavour curries, lightly crush the whole pod and it to the dish, and remember to use the whole pods for garnishing to add that dash of green. But remember to use it sparingly, as a little cardamom goes a long way.\nCombating Cold and Flu: If you are suffering from a flu, black cardamoms form the perfect soother. Just steep some pods in water with honey and it will relieve you effectively.\nAids Digestion: Its strong aroma helps in activating our taste and sensory elements, thereby aiding digestion. So, after a heavy meal keep some cardamoms by your side.\nMouth freshener: The floral and sweet aroma of cardamoms make it a natural breath freshener and helps promote oral hygiene.\nLowers high blood pressure: According to Ayurveda a concoction of a teaspoon coriander and one pinch of cardamom mixed with 1 cup of freshly squeezed peach juice can help bring down high blood pressure. Therefore, it is known to be a heart-friendly spice.\nSecret to good health: The Chinese believe drinking cardamom tea helps flushing out the toxins and keeps you healthy longer.\nSo, add a cardamom to your daily cup of tea, coffee, milk or a glass of warm water and honey, along with adding it to your sweet dishes and savoury ones alike, to make the most of this wonderful spice."}

Additionally, she serves as a thought-partner to the executive team to define, refine and communicate the Ironwood story.\nAs Ironwood kicked off 2016, the company had outgrown its science-heavy, startup-focused story frame and needed to better emphasize the unmet needs it was serving and the significant commercial capabilities it was leveraging to do so, including its award-winning marketing team and national sales force. Working closely with the CEO and the executive team, Morrison co-led the process of reframing Ironwood’s story as a commercial biotechnology company, advancing its key franchises in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation/chronic idiopathic constipation, refractory GERD and vascular/fibrotic disease.\nThe revised messaging and related materials debuted at the J.P. Morgan Health Care Conference in January 2016—biotech’s largest investor conference—and feedback from investors, analysts and Ironwood’s Board of Directors was positive. Moreover, these key messages carried through positively in the subsequent media placements—including the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg Businessweek, the Boston Globe, and myriad trade publications, including a cover story in Life Science Leader—that Ironwood secured. Outreach around this effort has garnered nearly 250 million impressions year-to-date."}

Others simply hide in plain sight.\nResearchers studied how jumping spiders use mimicry to disguise themselves as ants. While most animals mimic by altering their physical appearance, spiders do it by changing how they move.\nThat's because spiders are a more sought-after food than ants. But many of their predators — like some toads, lizards and wasps — have slow visual systems, so these spiders will move like ants to throw off attackers.\nThe arachnids' motions are pretty sophisticated, too. They will replicate winding movements like ants do when they're following pheromone trails.\nThey can even sell their act while standing still.

This is a record that will never leave my collection. Absolute monster.\nDARK FORCES, arguably the best track off Slam's debut album, gets the remix treatment here, and Claude Young is on the job for a harder mix, which doesn't differ greatly melodically, but messes around with the percussion some and adds an interesting interlude. Kenny Larkin also plays with the rhythms some while maintaining the original riff, though the track shifts into its own being 1/3 of the way through. With the b-sides, \"Sick Organ\" offers an off-kilter tech track with plenty of angular melodies to keep the ears intrigued, while \"Plastic Jazz\" goes on a shiny tech-house kick. Not much jazz, but plenty of Detroitian groove.\nOnce you have heard Dark Forces you won't forget it.

Build genuine, positive connections. Having strong references will help you stand out among other applicants.\nAs you apply for jobs, when listing references, make sure your references know you well.

{"completion": "One of the exhaust system improvements that can be performed on your Armadale HONDA is exhaust extractors. Extractors allow your car's engine to run more efficiently by allowing the exhaust gases to be pushed out more easily. This HONDA performance exhaust system upgrade will result in up to 15% better fuel economy, increased horsepower, increased torque and a cooler and cleaner running engine.\nThe combustion process of a petrol engine is never perfect. Dangerous gases, such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons will arise and it is the job of the catalytic converter to reduce these to safer emissions. These cat converters can fail by becoming clogged, or if the engine has bad exhaust valves or the plugs fail, causing unburned fuel to overheat the converter. Mettam's Mufflers can resolve these issues with your Armadale HONDA by replacing your damaged or clogged cat converter with a standard or hi-flow cat converter in under 1 hour.\nTwo examples of accessories that Mettam's Muffler's can provide to your Armadale HONDA are stainless steel mufflers and stainless steel tips and chrome ends.

Satellite systems, however, guarantee uniform coverage over a given area; within this area, all potential users enjoy the same access to services and the same quality of service. TV broadcasting is a practical illustration of this.\nIt is therefore important to determine if the satellite option can provide a technically appropriate response. Because most digitally-deprived localities tend also to be the least densely populated issues related to how this should be financed become highly relevant. However, it remains to be seen if a third component needs to be added to European strategy for space (the others are Galileo and GMES) to deal effectively with issues surrounding the digital divide. The colloquium should clarify many of these questions.\nThe colloquium will be on 22 January 2004 at the French Senate (Palais du Luxembourg) in Paris France."}

{"completion": "While Jeff Bezos was caught red-handed flashing around some random stuff last year, tax dollars from his multi-billionaire dollar Amazon empire weren’t among the booty.\nDespite posting profits of over $11 billion last year, the online shopping empire didn’t pay a single penny in federal taxes in 2018. Thanks to the company’s busy bookkeepers, it found clever ways of actually getting a federal income tax rebate of $129 million, which essentially means Uncle Sam dropped a maraschino cherry on top of Amazon’s massive cash slushie.\nMeanwhile, Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon who once earned more on his lunch break than some countries earn in months, has been crowned the wealthiest person on the planet. Last year, his net worth smashed $150 billion – some $50 billion more than Microsoft’s CEO runner-up Bill Gates.\nSo, as average Americans prepare for the annual ritual of mailing their tax returns by the April 15 deadline, many do so in the knowledge that they will owe Uncle Sam some money. Behemoth companies like Amazon, however, rarely have such worries. They have the means to avoid paying what many believe are their rightful dues. This was not the way things were supposed to be.\nIn 2017, Donald Trump, in one of his first acts as president, signed the so-called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.\nProponents of the legislation, underestimating the pervasive allure of greed, believed this reduction would make corporations more willing to crack open their purses and contribute their fair share to the tax load. Obviously, the plan backfired.\nThe new tax law “failed to broaden the tax base or close a slew of tax loopholes that allow profitable companies to routinely avoid paying federal and state income taxes on almost half of their profits,”according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP)."}

They were then asked to find a lighting item that they would like to buy from the website.\nUsers were immediately drawn to the large panel in the central section of the homepage. Some used this area as general navigation and missed the primary navigation at the top of the page. The effect of this was that these users missed some of the lighting products that were available to them, because this graphic was targeted to a certain type of product.\nThere was a mix of how users chose to navigate from the home page. There was a split between users clicking on to the main graphic, the primary navigation and the search box. When conducting a general search from the site search box, one user started typing in the search term ‘lights’. A drop down list of search suggestions appear in the search box but they were rather abstract for this particular user who chose ‘lights fantastic’ and was confused by the wording displayed to him.\nUsers did not play with the filters on the left hand side of the page. For lighting, users were more interested in the style of the item and were drawn to each product photograph to make their decision. Users looked at the brand names underneath the photographs and spent more time looking at the brands that they failed to recognise.\nOnce a user had found a product that they wanted to purchase they were re-directed to the retailer’s website. This was very slow for some users and they abandoned their journey. Users were shown a re-direction page that contained information regarding why they should shop with mydeco.com. Users stared at one bullet point that said ‘shop in your jimjams’. The actual word and the tone of the sentence was so different from what they were expecting to see that it caused users to look at it for longer than they might otherwise have done."}

However, In 2014 after many years of struggling with mental ill health I was admitted to a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service inpatient unit for treatment. I spent a year in two children’s psychiatric units in which I rekindled my love for creativity.

Creativity saved my life, and I am determined to bring it into the lives of other young people like me.\nThese days this blog is mostly a resource of information and personal experience of mental illness.

{"completion": "- Sari Colt on 六月 26, 2013.\nToronto’s historic Campbell House was the site for the SummerWorks Summer Soiree 2013 and Launch Party to raise funds and awareness for the 22nd annual SummerWorks Theatre Performance Festival. Guests had choices of Pitar wines and Mill Street Beer along with hors d’oeuvres like smoked Gouda grilled cheese sandwiches from Lakeview Restaurant and Devils on Horseback (bacon wrapped dates) from Samuel J Moore.\nThe various rooms of the Campbell House housed different theatre companies who performed teasers from their upcoming SummerWorks shows or created one-of-a kind pieces just for the Soirée. Magician Joe Culpepper, (Show and Tell Alexander Bell) delighted guests with his carnation magic trick.\nJani Lauzon (A Side of Dreams) showed guests how to make their own dreamcatchers, which allows good dreams to fall through the centre and nightmares to be caught in the web. In the piece ‘Four Words’, SummerWorks Artist-In-Residence and host of CBC Radio’s Definitely Not the Opera, Sook-Yin Lee (How Can I Forget) along with Adam Litovitz, Max Chandler, Stephanie Southmayd and Alice Lundy, encouraged the crowd to join them in creating a poem using only four words at a time. The witty poems were then sold for $4.00 or auctioned off to the highest bidder, much to the amusement of the crowd.\nOne highlight was the comedic libretto excerpt from Paradises Lost which follows the 200 year journey of the starship Discovery to colonize a new uninhabited planet.\nBluemouth Inc. staged a game of strip poker where participants had to reveal a truthful incident from their lives. And, some clothes did come off!\nAfter the VIP event, the doors were opened to the general public for the Launch Party with more treats, wines, live performances and music."}

{"completion": "The moment a groom asked the 6-year-old child of his bride to be his daughter for life at their wedding has gone viral (video below).\nDiogo Bolant, 37, surprised the young girl, named Isadora, at the wedding with her very own ring to bind them together, the Daily Mail reports.\nThe moment was captured on video and shared to Facebook. It has been viewed more than nine million times in just one week.\nOf course the little girl said yes without hesitation.\nDiogo then takes a ring out of a box and places it on Isadora’s finger as she cries and her mother, 27-year-old Nicole de Souza, looks on.\nIsadora responds by falling into her new stepfather’s arms, hugging him. Diogo then places a kiss on her cheek.\nBoth he and Nicole wanted Isadora to play a big role in their wedding ceremony, and since the 6-year-old is at that age where fantasizing about being a bride or a princess is cool, this was truly a dream come true.\nIsadora always hoped that Diogo and her mom Nicole would get married someday.\nNow this triad of love is officially a family, though it’s obvious from this photo that they were already so."}

She had the golden ring; the kids, the trophy husband, the house and car, the fancy law office, the respect of her colleagues… Well, maybe.

{"completion": "The MCU is a funny beast. Despite the titling, it's now become pretty difficult to isolate any single film as standalone - in my view they should have just stopped messing around and named this film MCU 13. That's not to say the labouring of the MCU is a bad thing; on the contrary really since Civil War really is one of the best film to have come out of the franchise so far. And yes, that includes Assemble.\nDespite being the easiest way to explain, it would be unfair to directly compare it to that the lynch pin movie of 2012. CW is mature, grown up, relying less on gimmicks and set pieces. There's more to the film than just the action and fan service. And yes, it does make you think (well, kind of). All of the characters come into their own (another reason why calling this a Captain America film could be seen as odd), and have been given more than enough potential to grow even more.\nThe downsides include some shoddy filming, especially during the fight scenes. Overall though the movie does get away with it, as it injects the blue, red and gold blurs into your eyeballs.\nI won't go on because it'll just end up being gush. Needless to say Civil War is a great film and very much recommended."}

{"completion": "This thesis presents three experimental studies on composite floor beams in fire that were performed in the Lehigh University ATLSS Furnace. The experiments include a predesigned W8x10 beam with limited existing damage subject to a realistic parametric fire curve with a decay phase, and two W12x26 beams – one bare steel and one insulated with a spray on fire resistant material - designed and tested with an E119 standard fire curve. The complete design and record of the tests are provided, including data on specimen temperatures and deflections.SAFIR 2016 was used to model the systems thermal and structural behavior at various levels of intensity. 2D beam, 3D beam, and 3D shell models were created to test the level of accuracy and predictability of the models. The 2D structural models were proven to be incapable of predicting accurate behavior of a composite system. MATLAB 2015 was used to verify temperature predictions using a three lumped mass calculation approach, and was shown to equal or exceed the performance of the thermal finite element models.A parametric study was conducted using the results from the two W12x26 test beams. The lengths of these beams were extended from the 11’-0” able to be accommodated in the furnace out to 15-0”’, 20’-0”, 25’-0”, and 30’-0” to study how the realistic lengths change the behavior of the tests. Validated SAFIR 3D beam and shell models were used to predict behavior, and show the differences and values between the two types of models.\nKordosky, Amy, \"Experimental and Computational Investigation of Composite Beam Response to Fire\" (2017).

The British Board of Film Classifcation have today published the results of a lot of extensive research they have decied to undertake on games and the gaming industry. A fair few of the findings are fairly obvious, it’s excellent that the words are coming from an offical regulatory body.\nIt’s also good to see someone taking an imaprtial and indeed through study of the subject, especially with such happenings of the recent shootings in the US, of which certain people are already jumping on the blaming video games bandwaggon (anyone who follows the industry already knows whom I’m talking about, the rest of you should do a search for Jack Thompson). The BBFC have also already been praised by Thompson previously, so I also feel the results of this survey, which pretty much debunk most of his arguments about the industry, are deliciously ironic for him.\nAnyway, I’m going to read the full report, and hopefully comment more later, but for those of you in a hurry and want to know the main points, you can read about it on the BBFC website, and then download the report and have a look for yourself here."}

{"completion": "The mortgage market this past week resulted in higher interest rates for those looking for new homes or refinancing their existing homes. The reasons behind this are pure speculation: The Federal Reserve may stop the bond buying program because new unemployment claims hit a low not seen in six years.\nFor several weeks, there has been ongoing speculation the Fed would stop the QE program they have been running to keep interest rates low. However, the markets are getting increasingly nervous as economic news continues to be positive. However, it is important to note that there is a significant chance the bond buying program will most likely not come to a screeching halt. Instead, the Fed will most likely taper this program off to ensure the markets do not over-react (much like what they are doing now).\nNone of these reports, outside of perhaps the Fed minutes, will drive the market too much in one direction or another. However, there is little doubt that as more economic data comes in that is positive, we will continue to see rates rising.\nMany who are refinancing an existing property or financing a new home often struggle with whether or not to lock in their interest rates at the time of their application. Keep in mind that locking a rate in often means paying extra points or paying a small fee upfront. However, the fee that you might incur could be worthwhile over the life of your loan.\nWhether you are purchasing a home or you are consider a refinance on your existing home, the time may be running short to lock in lower rates. Contact Core Mortgage Financial today and let us help you evaluate whether or not this is the right time for you to consider locking a rate in at today’s lower rates. Keep in mind, the markets are all indicating higher long-term interest rates so time may be running out."}

{"completion": "Over the last few days we’ve been quite surprisingly excited about getting some hands on time with the latest cycling mega title (this is a thing now, apparently) Le Tour De France 16. Being exercise avoiders and salad dodgers for quite some time now, it’s a title which we went into without really knowing what to expect, but we’ve come away fairly impressed and will definitely be sinking some more time into it very soon.\nYou may be imagining (as we were) that this title would be mostly about mashing your controller in a constant and concerted effort to retain the number one spot and hurtle your way through the stages of Le Tour, but this couldn’t be further form the game we’re presented with. Instead, fine strategy management is required for both your own stamina and your team’s efforts as well, to ensure a good finish for you at the end of each stage.\nIt’s a lot more in depth than we thought it would be, and for non-cycling enthusiasts, we’ve liked the detail and strategy which has been put into this, as well as the relaxing nature of the ride. While we’ve had an enjoyable (if sometimes a little baffling) experience, We imagine that this will be a hit for fans of the sport.\nSatisfaction: 7/10: It’s not a super high score but it’s definitely one we’ve enjoyed playing. While there’s nothing outstanding for us, we imagine that fans of Le tour or cycling in general may get a lot more out of the game though, and at £39.99, or 49.99 for the US and Europe, it’s not pricing itself out of the market.\nAs ever our Parent’s Guide above goes through all of the PEGI ratings and review elements, and don’t forget to Subscribe to keep up with all our News, Reviews, and Flashbacks."}

Rob took it to Tim Wilson and Mike Shannon at the Jackson factory in Ontario and had it completed into an assembled fully functional guitar.\nThis version of the prototype featured the revised RR V-shape like the previous black one but instead of being a string-thru-body hardtail, it was to be fitted with the Merlin 5-made brass tremolo that came on many of the strat-shaped Charvel's of that time. Grover at the time was becoming aquainted with a new trem designer named Gary Kahler about putting the Kahler tremolo on custom ordered Charvels. During this time, the tremolo was mentioned to Randy during the build stages of this guitar.\nRob told me Grover had it stored, wrapped up in the laundry room of his house in Mission Viejo (not far from where I now live).\nWe all know where the guitar is now via another thread in these message boards. Because Grover lives near me, I've had talks with Grover about it and he tells the story in a much broader light...it's always interesting to talk with Grover...lots of history in that dude!"}

{"completion": "Dog rose is a host of a small gall wasp (Diplolepis rosae) which lives in a bright-red gall called a “robin’s pincushion”. It has nothing to do with robins, but is a maze of up to 60 chambers, each containing a larva. Plants make galls as a protection when attacked by insects, fungi, bacteria, mites and small worms.\nThe leaves are compound. They are alternate and each has 5-7 leaflets.\nThe leaves are usually hairless and dark green. The underside of the leaf is lighter.\nThere is great variety between different dog rose plants and many hybrids exist. This makes identification difficult as all forms are very similar.\nThe flowering period is usually in June and July. They have 5 petals and these can vary from white to a light pink. The flowers have a strong and pleasant smell.\nDog rose fruits are bright red, ripening in September and into October.\nThe fruits are eaten by birds and small mammals. They help to disperse the seeds. Another way that this plant reproduces is by sending out ‘suckers’ from its roots. These new plants are genetically identical to the parent.\nYou can make a jam from the fruits they are rich in vitamin C.\nThe rose doesn’t have thorns, but spines. A thorn is a modified branch or stem and is made from the same substance as the stem itself.\nA spine, on the other hand, is a modified leaf and is made from a different material than the stem. Spines and thorns serve a number of functions – mainly defence, an aid to climbing or ‘rambling’ through other plants and as a tool to reduce the evaporation of water – protecting the plant in drought conditions.\nDog rose grows, or ‘rambles’ up to 3m tall. It doesn’t often reach this height as the branches tend to arch over.\nThe most common place to find the dog rose is in hedges. It also grows on poor meadows, woods, scrubland and at the woodland edge."}

Perhaps there were other, better courses I was missing?\nBut then I hadn’t known about Professor Maman. He had us all on that first morning — and I can almost remember all the others in the class, just from the memory of his deep voice bellowing “Monsieur Golfinos?” “Mademoiselle Beckett?” “Mademoiselle Lareuse?” “Monsieur Nagorski?” and so forth. Like the best of teachers, Maman was demanding and fun, in the right measures, and always engaging. He kept you on your toes, made you not only want to read Camus but come to class with something intelligent to say about it — in French, of course.\nMerci encore, Monsieur Maman!

You get to choose two entrees, plus you get soup, rice and drinks so we thought this was a good deal. It being our first time, we asked our server to recommend their bestsellers. Here's what we had.\nCrispy Honey Chicken- lightly battered and served in a sweet sauce over a bed of crispy rice sticks.\nThis package comes with Egg Drop Soup, rice and drinks.\nWe had high expectations. Service was good, but the food was nothing out of the ordinary. We've had better Chinese fare elsewhere. Maybe, if we do get the chance to visit again, we'll try something out from their regular menu."}

But have you ever thought, with the level of rising pollution, the water we get is something that we can consume directly? Just for the record, over five years to 2017, water-borne diseases, such as cholera, diarrhoea, typhoid and viral hepatitis caused 10,738 deaths, revealed a latest government data.\nThe Raskob grant helped RO Water Treatment Machine for the World reach four more rural communities in Honduras where, in addition to clean water, nearly 150 families got pit latrines.\nIt’s all part of the nonprofit agency’s water, sanitation and hygiene program to promote health and better lives for people in some of the poorest communities in Honduras and Haiti.\nIn addition, these facilities are important to the work of the Catholic Church. She referred to a seminarian in Trojes who said lack of basic services like clean water and sanitation affects church outreach. If priests, seminarians and catechists get sick, “this causes delays in preaching the word of God to families,” he told her.\nPure water equipment with RO system for the World teaches people in the areas they serve to be “community agents” and educate their neighbors about the water filters and latrines. This fosters community development, and “it is important to have reliable resources to build up their reliance on each other and strengthen their community,” said Brother Richard Iaquinto, Weston’s prior."}

{"completion": "Investing money on stocks is by no means easy since this takes you to do a range of things that can lead to optimal capital gain. Gathering data is one of many things you need in stock investment. Is that all enough? Not, you still need other things such as data analyzing and observing trend of investment based on specific news. Since there are a lot of things to do in your investment, you need to set enough time aside before you deal with it. Lucky for you, internet gives easy access of any data you need to make better investment, so you should benefit it.\nMaking investment on stock is about your ability of reading data on stock futures. In other words, you need to estimate some factors in order to be able to determine whether or not to invest your money at specific stocks. Some indicators on stock futures must be analyzed in details, so you can make a proper decision that lead to optimal profit. If you are a newbie in the stock investment, then consulting with an expert can be a choice and there will be many people who can give you a help in order that you can gain what it should in your investment.\nOne thing you need to bear in mind when it comes to investment is that risk goes in line with potential profit you can get, no matter what the financial instrument is. This rule applies to stock futures. Based on reliable data, investing money on stock is risky since it also offers high capital gain. This is the reason why paying attention to every single aspect of the investment is a must. Being an expert is a must if you want to invest your money on stock. Otherwise, you will get lost that will make you feel depressed."}

From what I experienced, and it's been a while since I've been in a batthing cage with a bat in my hand, the bat is everything they say it is - well-balanced, with the ability to flex - and the distance and speed are surely greater than I've ever accomplished with a wooden bat. My grandson echoes what I have said - and he can't wait for the snow to disappear so he can used it on the baseball team this spring. It's a real beauty in all respects!\nAfter trying many other products, Exposed Acne System has worked best! The system is easy to use and very effective. For any of you that have seen a dermotoglist, you will notice the same products recommended by your doctor are in Exposed products. I am so thankful I found this company and their products.

In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares Siemens with three other manufacturers of engines in Europe: Vestas Wind Systems AS of Denmark (2018 sales of 75.54 billion Danish Kroner [US$11.42 billion] of which 84% was Power Solutions), Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA of Spain (9.12 billion Euro [US$10.30 billion] of which 86% was Wind Turbine Manufacturing), and Alstom SA which is based in France (7.95 billion Euro [US$8.97 billion] of which 44% was Rolling stock).\nSales Analysis. Siemens reported sales of 83.04 billion Euro (US$93.73 billion) for the fiscal year ending September of 2018. This represents a decrease of 0.0% versus 2017, when the company's sales were 83.05 billion Euro. The sales level in 2018 was fairly close to the level five years ago: in 2013, Siemens had sales of 75.88 billion Euro. Contributing to the drop in overall sales was the 19.7% decline in Power and Gas, from 15.41 billion Euro to 12.38 billion Euro. There were also decreases in sales in Healthineers (down 3.1% to 13.32 billion Euro) and Reconciliation (down 14.1% to 1.09 billion Euro) . However, these declines were partially offset by the increase in sales of Digital Factory (up 14.8% to 12.23 billion Euro) and Energy Management (up 0.4% to 11.68 billion Euro) and Wind Power and Renewables (up 15.2% to 9.12 billion Euro) and Mobility (up 7.9% to 8.72 billion Euro) and Process Industries and Drives (up 0.3% to 7.22 billion Euro) and Building Technologies (up 1.9% to 6.48 billion Euro) and Financial Services (Sfs) (up 4.9% to 812.00 million Euro) ."}

This was funded by the German House for Research and Innovation (DWIH) , New Delhi and IndiaBioscience.\nThe concept of the workshop was to illustrate the methods and technical know-how required to prepare successful international research proposals. On Day 1, the workshop was in a ‘taught format’, and covered topics from identifying the adequate funding programmes, content development & grant writing to budget planning. Day 2 offered a proposal simulation game to allow for a hands-on preparation of a typical proposal outline, including a guided group work, evaluation/discussion, and feedback from the speakers. This model of specialized training workshops have proven successful in the German research landscape and the idea was to hold similar events in India, with focus on proposal writing and project management skill development that would enable young scientists in India, particularly those from partner institutions of the applying organizations to successfully apply for existing Indo-German joint programs and other international research funding opportunities. The workshop aimed to help sharpen the skills of the participants to apply for individual and collaborative third party funding programs.\nPhD students, Post Docs, Young Faculty from the Life Sciences.\nGroup work: how would you assess your present career situation and perspective?\nThe DWIH workshop was organised by the Max Planck Society (MPG) and Freie Universität Berlin India offices, in partnership with IndiaBioscience ."}

{"completion": "What Should You Ask Your Child's Teacher?\nYou and their teacher are probably two of the most influential people in your child's life. For that reason, it is imperative that you both work together to ensure your child makes the most out of their academic life. To learn what you should discuss next time you meet with the teacher, read the post below.\nIs your child being bullied? Is your child a bully? Are they a loner? Are they loud? Children can act very differently at school and at home. Learning about your child's social status will give you a better idea of who they are and how healthy their relationships are.\nSome people learn better with visual cues. Others, with auditory stimuli. While others require movement and touch. Ask the teacher about your child's learning style so you can both adapt to it and provide a more effective learning experience for your child.\nJust as the information the teacher gives you about your child can be very useful to you, so is the one you can provide to them. Ask them if there's anything they wish to know regarding your child, so the teacher can be properly informed and act accordingly.\nThese four little words can be music to a teacher's ears. This is because they let them know that you are a parent who is willing to work with them. Moreover, this opens up the dialogue between the two of you, which can benefit your child immensely.\nCall The Tutoring Center, League City TX at (281) 337-2800 if your child requires academic assistance (such as one-to-one tutoring in League City TX) to become a better student."}

This decision bucks the current global trend, with the goal of offering a higher standard of quality in the local winemaking sector.\nGran Selezione is produced from exclusively estate-grown grapes in the best-suited vineyards, applying strict regulations, which make it a highly prestigious wine and a new benchmark for the international winemaking scene.\nAs well as possessing the necessary chemical and sensory features for a high quality wine, before release Gran Selezione must be aged for at least 30 months in including three months of bottle ageing, with a subsequent required period of bottle maturation.\nGran Selezione is also credited with enhancing the various characteristic aspects of a vast and varied territory divided into nine municipalities, which differ greatly in climatic and pedological features, but are united by the unmistakeable “signature” of Sangiovese grapes. In sensory terms, Gran Selezione is a well-structured wine showing excellent balance and harmony thanks to grape selection and lengthy ageing, as well as deep, complex flavours and aromas.

Although Mazarin acquired the province of Alsace—making him a hero to French nationalists—he had a much more successful peace within his grasp, but lost it when he insisted on annexing the Spanish Low Countries. Sonnino also offers a new interpretation of the origins of the Fronde, linking the French domestic revolt to foreign policy, in Mazarin’s failure to secure peace with Spain.\nBased on unprecedented archival documentation, Mazarin’s Quest provides an original and illuminating look at one of the most complicated diplomatic gatherings of all time."}

{"completion": "The Poole No.1 Carpet Cleaning Pirates began their defence of the SGB Premiership title with an opening point from their meeting at Peterborough.\nIn a tight affair the Dorset side were able to keep their hosts on a tight reign throughout the meeting and even went into a two point advantage after 12 heats when Danish duo Nicolai Klindt and Nikolaj Busk Jakobsen withstood intense pressure from an 'on-the-edge' pursuit by Bradley Wilson-Dean. Sadly for the New Zealander his over zealousness led to him taking an uncomfortable fall on the final turn.\nBut, most unexpectedly, the new track record at the East of England Arena, Brady Kurtz ran a last place in heat 13 and with Rohan Tungate making a superlative pass on Jack Holder the home side were able to level the meeting once again.\nThat track record by Kurtz was accomplished in heat 6 when he breezed round the circuit in a four lap time of 57.8 seconds, shaving one-tenth of the time set by Max Fricke on April 1st this year who had lowered the previous fastest of 58.4 that had stood for nine years.\nPeterborough weighed in with a valuable 5-1 when eve of season signing Aaron Summers was well backed up by Charles Wright, the pair refusing to give Richie Worrall or Busk Jakobsen a look in. That left the Pirates needing to respond with a 5-1 of their own to eek out the draw on the night and whilst both Holder and Klindt made a great effort with solid starts, former Pirate Hans Andersen ensured the home win for the Panthers by getting in between them."}

{"completion": "Silver Tree has attractive grayish green-variegated silver foliage. The fuzzy oval leaves are highly ornamental and remain silver throughout the winter. Neither the flowers nor the fruit are ornamentally significant.\nSilver Tree is a multi-stemmed evergreen tree with a shapely oval form. Its relatively fine texture sets it apart from other landscape plants with less refined foliage.\nSilver Tree will grow to be about 40 feet tall at maturity, with a spread of 20 feet. It has a low canopy with a typical clearance of 1 foot from the ground, and should not be planted underneath power lines. It grows at a medium rate, and under ideal conditions can be expected to live for approximately 30 years.\nThis tree should only be grown in full sunlight. It does best in average to evenly moist conditions, but will not tolerate standing water. It is particular about its soil conditions, with a strong preference for poor, alkaline soils, and is able to handle environmental salt. It is somewhat tolerant of urban pollution, and will benefit from being planted in a relatively sheltered location. This species is not originally from North America.\nSilver Tree is a fine choice for the yard, but it is also a good selection for planting in outdoor pots and containers. Because of its height, it is often used as a 'thriller' in the 'spiller-thriller-filler' container combination; plant it near the center of the pot, surrounded by smaller plants and those that spill over the edges. Note that when grown in a container, it may not perform exactly as indicated on the tag - this is to be expected. Also note that when growing plants in outdoor containers and baskets, they may require more frequent waterings than they would in the yard or garden. Be aware that in our climate, this plant may be too tender to survive the winter if left outdoors in a container. Contact our store for more information on how to protect it over the winter months."}
{"completion": "When you’re on the road, you often want to pull off for a cup of coffee or a bite to eat. Once you do, the road starts to beckon again almost immediately.\nLeesville, New York, was one of the most western posts on the First Great Western Turnpike, built as a toll road from Albany, the state capital, to the frontier town of Cherry Valley in the late 18th century. Commerce didn’t come cheap – drivers (of a different sort) paid 3 cents per dozen to move their sheep and swine along the road. No tolls were collected from people going to or returning from church or the grist mill, or from those who were on military duty or on journeys within the town where the tollgate was located.\nThis is as urban as it gets along Route 20 in New York, as it passes through the state capital of Albany. Here it runs along the Empire State Plaza, home to the offices of state legislators and executive branch agencies. More compelling, perhaps, is the egg-shaped structure called, appropriately enough, The Egg, a performing arts center that descends six stories below ground level.\nModern-day Albany is a far cry from its early days. It was first settled as the Dutch trading posts of Fort Nassau (1614) and lays claim to being the longest continually chartered city in the United States (chartered in 1686)."}

{"completion": "Like a jeweled half moon, The Mandarin Oriental Hotel prominently sits on the crown of Brickell Key facing out to the Biscayne Bay. The hotel is contemporary in decor with Asian accents but not overpowering. Many celebrities have stayed at this hotel near downtown Miami with 180 degree view of the water. All restaurants, the pool, lounge bar, gym, and massage suites face the glittering water.\nThe Mandarin houses two restaurants--Azul and Cafe Sambal.\nCafe Sambal is the more casual of the two but with upscale standards and resides on the lower level. Embroidered by an inner band of rich, fuschia-colored bougainvillea and surrounded by glistening green-blue water, the alfresco dining section is like a brilliant ruby and emerald gem ring setting. The Miami Skyline in the backdrop was surreal. Not many restaurants can boast both water and skyline view.\nFor an appetizer, the soy beans \"Steamed Edamame with Hawaiian Seasalt\" was highly recommended by Kristin, the Sales Manager. Placing the string of beans in between my teeth to remove the encapsulated bean (similar to cracking sunflower seeds and separating the seed from the shell), I pulled the other end of the bean for a clean sweep. The glittering bronze sea salt was the singular flavor. The Edamame is eaten for the experience and the health factor. At $8.00 for a deep dish bowl, the edamame is a pure protein snack. Once you have one, you can't stop until the bowl is empty.\nOverall, this restaurant deserves high marks for food, flavor and ambience. Prices are on the high end which is to be expected for an upscale hotel for the rich and famous.\nIf you visit Cafe Sambal, please return to this posting and share your experience by clicking on \"Comments\" just below this article."}

It is also the first try of using my new KNK Zing electronic cutting machine in my scrapbooking projects.\nIt was an experiment and it went almost well. There were problems at first but I could make corrections and solve them. The technique involves a lot of die cutting.

The software that comes with it is easy to use. It took me less then half an hour to design the cutting project. Then I tested it on regular paper and went on to my colored cardstock.
